## Give Feedback on the Federal Grants Management Data Standards 

You can provide feedback on the Federal Grants Management Draft Data Standards in four easy steps! 
1. Sign up for a [FREE GitHub Account](https://github.com/). If you already have a GitHub Account skip to Step 2.
2. Review the 426 Data Standards Elements in the table below. Use the search box in the top right corner to filter by keyword.
3. Select the “Leave Feedback” button to open a new tab and select "Get Started." Enter your comments in the box for a single data element, being sure to title that comment with the data element number. You must submit a separate comment/issue for each data element. (Note: Toggle back to the Draft Grants Data Elements Feedback main page in the previous tab to review content and data elements.)
4. Select “Submit New Issue” to submit your comments. Repeat the process for each data element you have feedback for.

To provide feedback on the Draft Data Elements, refer to the User Guide. Please ensure that you reference which data element you are commenting on. Please create a new issue for each data element you comment on. 

All comments received may be posted without change, including any personal information provided. **All comments will be made public** and are subject to the Freedom of Information Act. Do not submit confidential business information, trade secret information, or other sensitive or protected information that you do not want to be available to the public. *(The comment period is from November 15, 2018 to January 15, 2019. **Update:** Due to lapse in appropriations, this portal remains open for comments after January 15, although OMB will not be reviewing responses or available to answer questions. OMB will evaluate the comment period deadline in light of the lapse of appropriations once the lapse ends.)*
